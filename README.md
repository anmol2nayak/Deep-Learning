üåø ConvNeXt-Tiny for Advanced Cotton Disease Detection and Severity Estimation

Project Overview

This repository documents a successful Deep Learning comparative study aimed at developing a highly accurate system for classifying major cotton crop diseases. We benchmarked three state-of-the-art CNN architectures‚ÄîConvNeXt-Tiny, RegNet, and Xception‚Äîand selected ConvNeXt-Tiny as the most robust model for disease diagnosis.

Our work serves as a powerful foundation for a future Precision Agriculture tool focused on quantifiable, actionable data for farmers.

Next-Generation Feature: Disease Severity Quantification (The Unique Contribution)

To move beyond simple classification (i.e., answering "What disease?"), our project is structured to implement Image Segmentation (answering "How much damage?"). This is our key contribution to precision agriculture:

Disease Localization: The model will precisely localize the diseased lesions on the cotton leaf.

Severity Index: It will quantify the damage by calculating the exact percentage of the leaf area affected.

Actionable Data: This severity index enables farmers to administer precision chemical applications, reducing waste, cost, and environmental impact.

üíª Repository Setup & Experiments

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and install the necessary dependencies using the provided file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


(Note: PyTorch is used for ConvNeXt/RegNet and TensorFlow is used for Xception.)

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]


Data: Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included. The models rely on a structured directory: data/train/, data/val/, and data/test/, each containing class sub-folders (healthy, bacterial_blight, etc.).

üõ£Ô∏è Future Work Roadmap

Our immediate focus is on converting the classification backbone into a full diagnostic tool:

Segmentation Implementation: Integrate a Segmentation Head (e.g., U-Net variant) with the ConvNeXt feature extractor to measure the affected leaf area.

Real-Time Optimization: Optimize the final model into a lightweight format (e.g., TFLite, ONNX) for fast, on-device inference on mobile devices.

Generalization and Robustness: Expand training data using images from diverse field environments, varying lighting conditions, and different growth stages to ensure reliable performance across all real-world scenarios.
