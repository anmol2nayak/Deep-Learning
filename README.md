Autonomous Window Line Drone Delivery System using Computer Vision
An autonomous drone delivery system using deep learning to navigate and deliver packages to windows in high-rise buildings. It uses UNet for line segmentation, YOLOv8/Faster R-CNN for window and obstacle detection, and a PID controller for flight path correction. Built with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and AirSim.
